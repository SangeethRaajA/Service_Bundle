# Service_Bundle
software architecture assignment 01

INTRODUCTION ✔✔✔✔

We have implemented a Lockdown Emergency Bill Service System using Eclipse Equinox OSGI Framework. 
Let us explain this briefly, the system comprises of three producers: Gas service management,
Mobile Reload Service Management, Transport Service Management and One Consumer. 
The purpose of having one customer is that if more than one consumer bundles are implemented, 
all the consumer bundles will be having in the same way which will be duplicate implementation 
of consumer bundles. The IDE used was Eclipse written on Java programming language.
We decided to choose this system by considering the current lockdown situation of our country. 
This billing system will help the small scale business people and local people to make sure 
the get the service at right price and the bill will be an evidence of their purchase or the service charge, 
this will reduce business frauds.
